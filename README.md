# The-simpletron
An implementation of the simpletron from the book  "[C how to program(H.M. Deitel/P.J. Deitel)](https://deitel.com/c-how-to-program-9-e/)"

This exercise is provided as an exercise in the above book.
The idea is to create a small, virtual computer that can execute programs written in Simpletron machine language(SML).

first part(end of chapter 7, exercise 7.18):  write the simpltron to prompt the user for the program, one instruction at a time. Doneâœ…

second part(end of chapter 11, exercise 11.17): modify the simpletron to load the program from a file.

third part (end of chapter 12, exercise 12.26): Programmers do not like writing programs in machine codeðŸ˜¶. write a compiler that converts programs written in a high level language(called simple) to SML
final(bonus?) part(exercise 12.30): write an interpreter for simple.

note: I am using the second edition. different editions may have the exercises in different locations.

## I will update this page soon...
